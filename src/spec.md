# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable users to submit clothing items for resale, upcycling, or recycling through pop-up dialogs and earn green credits that are added to their wallet balance.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace external link behavior on Resale, Upcycle, and Recycle buttons with pop-up submission dialogs
- Add form fields for clothing type and number of pieces in the pop-up
- Calculate and display credits earned based on submission category and quantity
- Store clothing submissions in backend with type, clothing description, quantity, credits, and timestamp
- Update GreenCreditWallet balance automatically when submissions are processed
- Show new submissions in recent activity section of GreenCreditWallet
- Maintain simple, clean design using existing sage green and off-white color palette

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click Resale, Upcycle, or Recycle buttons to open a submission form, enter their clothing details and quantity, see how many credits they'll earn, submit the form, and immediately see their updated credit balance in the GreenCreditWallet.
