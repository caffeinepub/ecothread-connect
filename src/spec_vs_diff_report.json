  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all requested requirements. A submission dialog component was created with proper form fields, backend storage was implemented with Motoko actor methods, and the GreenCreditWallet was updated to display submissions and balance changes. The implementation maintains the existing design aesthetic and color palette.",
